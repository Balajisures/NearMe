    Mayuranathaswamy Temple, Mayiladuthurai or Mayuranathar Temple is a Hindu temple in the town of Mayiladuthurai (formerly known as Mayavaram or Mayuram) in Tamil Nadu, India. The temple is dedicated to Lord Mayuranathaswamy, a form of Shiva, and has given its name to the town itself.[1] The main icon is a lingam and the presiding deity is called Mayuranathar because the Hindu goddess Parvathi worshipped Shiva here in the form of a mayura.
